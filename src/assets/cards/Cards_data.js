        Kiara, a girl who always dreamed of being part of royalty. This is a great opportunity for her to fulfil her dream and she will do anything to win.
        Cole, a guy who is sly and cool. He thinks the throne was meant for him and tricks others into doing the work for him.

        Now that the gang's friendship had gotten stronger and they were on their holiday, Emily got a clue from Isabelle which could lead to her brother that disappeared 8 years ago but the journey would be dangerous and she isn't strong enough to get him now.
        Will she wait till she is 18 years old and grown enough to reveal her identity and take her brother back, or will she disregard everything and go now? Will she find him or will it be a dead end? Why did Emmett disappear that time? What happened to him? Why didn't he bother to come back? She had so many questions in her mind but out of all the numerous questions, one question greatly bothered her. Is Emmett truly safe?
