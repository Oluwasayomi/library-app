## 🏛️ Library App

A library app for books written by a particular author (Tennyliz), including the book details and a link to the online reading platform. In essence, it is a library app that has all of an author's books in one place, in an easy-to-navigate format for readers. This app is built using React.js, Vite, CSS, api implementation, with Firebase for the database.

## 🛠 Technologies

* HTML
* Vanilla CSS
* JavaScript
* React.js
* Vite
* Firebase
* Toastify

## 💡 Features

Here are the website's features:

* Sign-in/Sign-up page
* Animated buttons on hover.
* Complementary colour theme (brown, black, and white).
* Aesthetically pleasing visualisation and interaction.
* Event listener (for the button, navbar, and login)
* Book details (making use of the book ID)
* React Toastify for beautiful notifications.
* Api key implementation for the database.
* Environment variable to protect said api information.
* App responsiveness for different screen sizes. 

## ✍️ The Process

Oftentimes, websites/apps for books are very well organised, with various genres and recommendations. However, when you click on a beloved author's page, all their books are simply categorised under 'Published Books', leaving it up to the Author to make their page intuitive enough so that readers know which books would catch their fancy. 
This is especially frustrating for the readers when the author has various books with even more varied genres, and all you want is a book just like the one you just read from this same author. 

This app fixes that by categorising the author's books into different genres and giving you recommendations based on the books you have read by the author! With this, it builds the bridge between author and reader, making the reader more likely to read and enjoy the author's work, as well as reducing the work for the author having to promote their books themselves! 

I first catalogued all the author's books, ensuring I had the different genres/types for each book. Looking into the design format, I brought the idea to life using React, styling it with CSS to create the home page. Once the basic website was in place, I allocated those types to each book, ensuring they showed up under the appropriate section on the home page. I then added a function to ensure the books' listing would be randomised, instead of staying the same all the time. 

I then created the sign-in/sign-up page, adding various details to it, such as having to put in a strong password, having proper credentials, etc. I also added the user's information to the database to ensure proper sign-in. I also added a short loading screen that would show when the user successfully logged in, before bringing them to their home page. 

Afterwards, I worked on the styling based on the screen size, ensuring the website was adaptable for PC, tablet, and phone views. I also added scrolling functions, button animations, and other event listeners to make the website more interactive. I also made the pop-up login/register form and other necessary adjustments to ensure the website was responsive 

Finally, I added a logout dropdown and made other necessary adjustments/bug fixes to ensure the web app was fully functional.

This was a full-stack development challenge that aimed to connect literature and technology through intuitive design, personalised book discovery, and secure, scalable architecture.
